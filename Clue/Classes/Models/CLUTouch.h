/**
 @brief `CLUTouch` is a proxy for UITouch data and properties dictionary generator for this data.
 
 @discussion `CLUTouch` is a data model to store UITouch's data in appropriate way. Since the system reuse UITouch object with each user interaction we can't just store in in out collection in order to generate their properties data dictionary (via UITouch category) and add this data to final report file. Instead we have to transfer UITouch values to our custom class `CLUTouch` and interaction with it.
 
 Used in `CLUGeneralGestureRecognizer` in order to transfer UITouch to CLUTouch.  Also `CLUInteractionObserverDelegate` protocol requires CLUTouch instead of UITouch
