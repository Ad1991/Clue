/**
 `CLUViewStructureModule` is a subclass of `CLUObserveModule` for view hierarchy recording for any specific time. It will record all views currently present on the top view controller (properties of those views and their subviews as well). Also `CLUViewStructureModule` keep track of last recorded view structure so it won't record same view structure twice.
